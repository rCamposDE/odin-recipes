        <li>1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>

        <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li>

    <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
    <H4><STRONG>MAKE SAUCE</STRONG></H4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).</li>
    </ol>
    <H4>COOK SPAGHETTI</H4>
    <ol>
        <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
    </ol>
    <H4>TO FINISH</H4>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
    </ol>
