    <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>A food processor helps to chop vegetables so they look like coarse crumbs. This makes up most of the burger, which means you see the little bits of vegetable throughout the patty (see the photo below).</li>
        <li>Two eggs help firm up the middles of the burgers so they stay together when you take a bite. If you don’t eat eggs, don’t worry, flax eggs are an excellent substitute. I’ve shared our tips below.</li>
        <li>Watch out for over processing the burger mixture.</li>
        <li>Fold in cooked brown rice before forming the burger patties. The rice gives extra texture and bites back a bit when you take a bite.</li>

    <H4>Making Vegan Veggie Burgers</H4>
    <p>
    When we first created this recipe, we called on eggs to help bind the burger together. They work like a charm, but since sharing these burgers with you, many of you have asked about making them vegan friendly.
    Flax eggs are perfect in this recipe! They help bind and firm up the middles of the burgers. Here’s what you’ll need to make these veggie burgers vegan:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use 2 flax eggs instead of the 2 eggs called for in the recipe. (Readers have commented that chia eggs work, as well. We have not tried this, yet.)</li>
        <li>To make 2 flax eggs, whisk 2 tablespoons flaxseed meal with 6 tablespoons water. Set the mixture aside for 15 in the refrigerator then use in the recipe below.</li>
    </ul>
