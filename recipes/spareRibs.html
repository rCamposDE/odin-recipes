    <h1>SpareRibs</h1>
    <h2><strong>Easy Fall Off the Bone Oven-Baked Ribs</strong></h2>
    <img src="./SR.jpg" alt="rcb" >
    <p><strong>These are the best ribs!</strong> Baking low and 
        slow is our secret to fall off the bone oven-baked 
        ribs. Some people think that ribs should be left 
        to the “pit masters” — it’s just not true. Baking 
        ribs in the oven is seriously easy. All you 
        need is time — 95% of the recipe time is sitting 
        back and relaxing while the ribs bake. 
        <strong>Let’s do this! Jump to the Oven-Baked 
        Ribs Recipe</strong></p>

    <h3><strong>YOU WILL NEED</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 or 2 spare ribs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the membrane (remember, this ensures fall off the bone ribs).</li>
        <li>Generously season both sides with salt and pepper. This is also a great opportunity for adding more flavor with your favorite spice rub.</li>
        <li>Cover the ribs with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake the ribs at a low temperature (275°F) for 2 ½ to 4 hours or until they are tender.</li>
        <li>Slather the baked ribs with barbecue sauce, and then broil (or grill) the ribs for a few minutes until the sauce is caramelized.</li>
    </ol>
<H4>COOK SPAGHETTI</H4>
<ol>
    <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
</ol>
<H4>Sweet and Spicy Barbecue Sauce</H4>
<p>You can use any barbecue sauce you like, but for us, we like to cook up our quick sweet and spicy sauce — it only takes a few minutes. It combines ketchup, brown sugar, chili sauce (like Sriracha), and spices. We’ve shared how to make it in the recipe.

I like making a double batch of the sauce and keeping it in the refrigerator. It will last up to 5 days. The sauce is perfect with chicken, on a burger, or as a dip for fries.
